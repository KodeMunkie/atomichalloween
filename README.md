# Atomic Halloween
Hacky hardcoded Halloween icon animation player for M5Atom

## About

Displays 4 simple Halloween themed 5x5 "pixel" animations
on the M5Atom's matrix.

This code is all a bit of fun for my 1 and 5 year olds, 
the icons were designed and the program written in a 
couple of hours before Halloween - hope you get some
enjoyment out of it too!

Feel free to submit new MRs for icons, improved playback,
different holidays etc. It's all a bit of pointless fun :)

Nb. if you're snooping for quality code this is not it - 
magic numbers, no tests, no code comments etc ...!
